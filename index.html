        <p>The largest pro-Israel PAC in the country – American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) – has contributed over $1 million to New York’s sitting congress members since 2022. There are no U.S. representatives who have accepted contributions from AIPAC that have publicly called for a ceasefire. <br><br>

        Of the 26 sitting representatives, <a href="https://twitter.com/prem_thakker/status/1733265478481588374">only three of them</a> have called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza – Representatives Nydia Velázquez, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Jamaal Bowman. Other members of congress have <a href="https://bush.house.gov/media/press-releases/calls-for-ceasefire-grow-in-month-following-introduction-of-ceasefire-now-resolution">introduced H. Res. 786</a>, the Ceasefire Now Resolution, urging the Biden Administration to call for a ceasefire in Palestine and Israel and to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. <br>

        Thousands of protestors have hit the streets to demand a ceasefire as the death toll in Palestine <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-have-died-gaza-war-how-will-counting-continue-2023-12-06/">topples over 17,000 people</a> since October 7, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. <br><br>

        Biz Peterson was one of those attendees at a pro-Palestinian rally last month. She said she’s been calling her representatives everyday. <br><br>

        “A ceasefire is only the start,” <a href="https://indypendent.org/2023/11/a-movement-in-motion-looking-back-at-a-week-of-action-as-bombardment-of-gaza-continues/">she told</a><i> The Indypendent.</i> “I’m just hoping that politicians are going to start learning the lesson that come 2028, Gen Z and millennials are going to be the majority in this country. We will hold the voting power and we will vote them out of office.”
